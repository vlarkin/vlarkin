#### About
I’m a Senior Software Engineer with more than 7 years of experience in developing, implementing and maintaining complex and reliable infrastructures in GCP and AWS clouds.

I use Kubernetes together with CI/CD pipelines and automation to ensure the seamless and efficient deployment of applications developed in line with core SDLC principles.

In Revolut I excelled in a hybrid role of SRE and DBA, orchestrated strategies for system reliability while concurrently performing database administration for uninterrupted operations.

My overall career in IT engineering is more than 25 years and I have a strong background in security, highly loaded systems, server hardware, network equipment and Linux systems.

I'm happy to share my experience regarding the technologies I use in my work:

I always work with a strong level of curiosity, paying close attention to details. This helps me find effective solutions to challenges. I’m eager to learn, open-minded, and self-motivated for continuous improvement.
